# AI Detector Project Instructions

This project implements an AI text detector using machine learning models to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for model training and evaluation
- `models/` - Trained model files and configurations
- `data/` - Training and testing datasets
- `streamlit_app/` - Streamlit web interface
- `src/` - Source code modules
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Models Used
1. RoBERTa-based classifier
2. DistilBERT classifier

## Development Guidelines
- Use Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and training
- Implement modular code in src/ directory
- Use Streamlit for web interface
- Follow data science best practices for model evaluation
